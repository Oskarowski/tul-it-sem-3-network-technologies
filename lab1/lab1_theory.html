    <h1>Task 1</h1>

    <h2>Name origin</h2>

    <p>
      The model is called the ISO OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Reference
      Model because it deals with connecting open systems- that is, systems that
      are open for communication with other systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Sense behind designing layers</h2>

    <p>
      The OSI model has seven layers. The principles that were applied to arrive
      at the seven layers can be briefly summarized as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        A layer should be created where a different abstraction is needed.
      </li>
      <li>Each layer should perform a well-defined function.</li>
      <li>
        The function of each layer should be chosen with an eye toward defining
        internationally standardized protocols
      </li>
      <li>
        The layer boundaries should be chosen to minimize the information flow
        across the interfaces.
      </li>
      <li>
        The number of layers should be large enough that distinct functions need
        not be thrown together in the same layer out of necessity and small
        enough that the architecture does not become unwieldy
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Brief layers' description</h2>

    <h3>The Physical Layer</h3>
    <p>
      The physical layer is concerned with transmitting raw bits over a
      communication channel.
    </p>

    <h3>The Data Link Layer</h3>
    <p>
      The main task of the data link layer is to transform a raw transmission
      facility into a line that appears free of undetected transmission errors.
    </p>

    <h3>The Network Layer</h3>
    <p>The network layer controls the operation of the subnet.</p>

    <h3>The Transport Layer</h3>
    <p>
      The basic function of the transport layer is to accept data from above it,
      split it up into smaller units if need be, pass these to the network
      layer, and ensure that the pieces all arrive correctly at the other end.
    </p>

    <h3>The Session Layer</h3>
    <p>
      The session layer allows users on different machines to establish sessions
      between them.
    </p>

    <h3>The Presentation Layer</h3>
    <p>
      Unlike the lower layers, which are mostly concerned with moving bits
      around, the presentation layer is concerned with the syntax and semantics
      of the information transmitted.
    </p>

    <h3>The Application Layer</h3>
    <p>
      The application layer contains a variety of protocols that are commonly
      needed by users.
    </p>

                There is in fact Bluetooth radio layer. It deals with radio
                transmission and modulation. It corresponds fairly well to the
                physical layer in the OSI model.

              The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is a virtual private network
              (VPN) protocol that creates a connection between your device and a
              VPN server without encrypting your content.

              It provides services related to the session layer of the OSI model
              allowing applications on separate computers to communicate over a
              local area network. As strictly an API, NetBIOS is not a
              networking protocol.

          DB-25 connectors
